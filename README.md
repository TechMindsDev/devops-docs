# Intent of the Blog

While adopting the distributed architecture and a resilient tech stack, the overall IT environment has become little complex as the greater number of applications based on microservices that span everything from containers to serverless computing frameworks are deployed in production environments. Most of those distributed applications are being built and deployed using DevOps practice.

The pressure has intensified to bridge the **cultural divide** that has long existed between traditional IT operations teams and application development teams that have embraced best DevOps practices.

At the core of that DevOps culture is a desire on the part of DevOps teams to automate IT process management. Tasks that once required IT personnel to implement manually now are being automated by developers employing tools and platforms that expose both APIs and command-line interfaces \(CLIs\). Not every IT task can be fully automated just yet, but with the adoption of DevOps practice a great leap forward is clearly being made.
