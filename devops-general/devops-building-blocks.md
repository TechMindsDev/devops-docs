# What is DevOps?

## Introduction

What does DevOps mean for teams? 

To put it in a simple terms, DevOps just enables formerly siloed roles - development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security - to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, transparent, faster and more reliable products. 

DevOps is **not a seperate function** which is different from the above roles, rather there could be a centralised **expert team** with the key expertise of automating operations, develop tools and capabilities for the above teams to leverage and be **self-sustained** to build, deploy, monitor and release developed work much faster and efficiently. In most cases this centralised team's function is misunderstood for the day-to-day operational tasks, which needs to change in the minds of the these departments as part of adopting DevOps Culture.
