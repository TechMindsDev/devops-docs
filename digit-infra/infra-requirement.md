# Infra Requirement

## Overview

While DIGIT is a microservice based and cloud native platform/application, it can literally be deployed anywhere based on this [recommendations](infra-recommendation.md). 

**Public Clouds:** All the public clouds like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.. will have the kubernetes as completely managed services with full fledged elasticity, secured, optimized, pay-as-u-go, instantaneous, cost-effective ways to provision a kubernetes cluster.  

**Private Clouds:** Most of the SDCs and NICs are essentially a private clouds that has got the basic services like VMs, Storage, Network, Load Balancers, Routers, Firewall, etc. These are the infra requirements to create kubernetes cluster as well. Some SDCs might already have kubernetes as a manages services, where you may just have to subscribe to it. Where as some SDCs might kubernetes as a service in case if the underlying Infra was either from VMware, IBM, Nutanix, OpenStack, Oracle, etc.

In case of managed kubernetes service availability you can directly subscribe to it and get started with the kubernetes cluster instantaneously. Just the worker nodes capacity to be estimated based on the number applications and anticipated load. [Refer here to provision infra on public cloud.](../devops-general/the-rise-of-kubernetes/setup-kubernetes/on-cloud.md)

In the absence of the kubernetes as a managed service, one needs to provision the kubernetes cluster from the available base infra.  [Refer this to provision kubernetes cluster on private cloud where managed kubernetes cluster is not available](../devops-general/the-rise-of-kubernetes/setup-kubernetes/on-premise-1/).  

### **Infra Requirement** 

**Public Clouds:** All the public clouds like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.. will have the kubernetes as completely managed services with full fledged elasticity, secured, optimized, pay-as-u-go, instantaneous, cost-effective ways to provision a kubernetes cluster.  

**Private Clouds:** Most of the SDCs and NIC are essentially a private clouds that has got the basic services like VMs, Storage, Network, Load Balancers, Routers, Firewall, etc. These are the infra requirements to create kubernetes cluster as well. Some SDCs might already have kubernetes as a managed service in case of the underlying Infra was either from VMware, IBM, Nutanix, OpenStack, Oracle, etc. Where as some SDCs might have to provision kubernetes as a service from the bare-metal or simple VM infrastructure.

To provision a kubernetes cluster you need master nodes (VMs) for the kubernetes cluster components and worker nodes (VMs) for the application workload that'll be deployed.
